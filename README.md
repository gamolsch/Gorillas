##Wireframes##

Create a solid set of wireframes of the pages/ states of pages of your application. Use a tool like Balsamiq or sketch them on paper.

Discuss what your core pages are and what your core user flows are. There should be two core flows: survey creation and survey completion.

##User Stories##

Create a solid set of user stories for your application. Use your wireframes to guide stories (ie what happens when a user clicks here?).

You have two types of users in this application, survey creators and survey takers; build stories for both.

List your user stories in Trello.

##MVP##

Decide what your MVP will be. Make sure you have wireframes and user stories for all parts of your MVP.

Create a repository for your project. In your repository README include

##Team name and team members##
A brief description of your MVP
[A link to your team Trello board](https://trello.com/surveygorilla)
A link to your wireframes
A brief description of your team dynamic and git workflow.
